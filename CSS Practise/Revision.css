/* CSS  is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or Xml. It describe how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech or on other media */
/*There are 3 different way to apply css to our document there is an external style. Sheet, internal style sheet or we could apply CSS inline with an element.*/

/* Topic 1 */

/*There are 3 different way to apply CSS to our document i.e
1.) External Style Sheet  2.)Internal Style Sheet  and 3.) Inline css with an element */

p4 {
    color: greenyellow;
}


/* The inlined CSS take precedent over either type of style sheet internal or external because its applied directly to the element itself */

/* best commonly used method for using css is external style sheet,it keep our css code completely seperate from our html */

/*Topic 2*/

/* There are 3 type of basic selector in CSS i.e

1> Element Selector  2>class selector  3> id selector*/

/*Element Selector example*/
p2 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 64px;
}

/*Class Selector examples*/

.Ankit {
    color: orange;
}

/*id selector*/

#third {
    font-style: italic;
}

h1,
h2 {
    color: blueviolet;
}

/* However,it is not good practise to really use id inside of your CSS now it will validate your code has no problem using an id */

/*However typically we should use classes and sometime element selector but rarely id selector*/

/* This means selector is looking for any h2 that exist inside of an h1. so it doesnot work*/
h1 h2 {
    color: aqua;
}

/*Selecting an element thats inside another element*/

section span {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    background-color: gold;
}

.highlight {
    text-transform: uppercase;
    background-color: rosybrown;
}

/* This would keep our css much more organized and actually more reusable, it is more flexible this way because we might have same span elements doing other things that we did not want to apply this rule set too*/

/* Universal Selector */

/* This means it's selecting everything on the page*/
* {
    font-family: monospace;
}

/* CSS is an acronym for cascading style sheets ( it means css work like a waterfall i.e it work from top to down */

.hero {
    color: aquamarine;
}


p {
    color: #ff0000;
}

/* But cascading don't work when in the above case, as we can see that class have more specificity than an element selector*/


/*Inheritance = That is where another element inherits the settings from or the parent element, so the body element is parent to every other element*/

/* 
body {
font-size: 22px;            it is inheritance
border: 3px solid black;     it is Non inheritance
}  */

/*we want to write less code and be more efficient and inheritance helps us to do that.

/* Topic 4*/

/* CSS units determine the size of everything in our page. It is of two categories i.e relative and absolute */

header {
    width: 80%;
}

/* If the width of parent class i.e header is 80% than we are only using up to 50% of 80% of the pg*/
h3 {
    border: 2px dashed red;
    width: 50%;
}

/* rem: This is the unit that we'll typically used for fontsize and it relates to the fontsize of root element  */
/* we shouldn't set a font size on the root element. So for HTML element(root element) we typically wouldn't set a font size because we want to let the browser handle that and set the default font size*/

main {
    font-size: 3rem;
}

#a3 {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
}

/*  It's not relative to the parent,it is relative to the root which is defined by browser. Using the rem and always looking at the root definitely help*/

/* When we set the font size on an element, em doesn't looks at the parent it looks at the element itself and so we could use it for something like margin and padding */

h3 {
    font-size: 3rem;
    /* 1em= the font-size of the parent element*/
    padding: 0.5em;
}

/*Both em and rem are relative units in CSS, used mainly for:
(Fonts,Padding,Margin,Widths/Heights,Media queries, etc.)

✅ em – Relative to Parent Element

1em = the font-size of the parent element
Useful for creating scalable layouts that adjust based on where they are used
Nested ems multiply
it is inherited

Example:
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

.container {
  font-size: 2em; /* 2 × 16px = 32px
 } */



/* ✅ rem – Relative to Root Element

1rem = the font-size of the <html> element
"rem" = "root em"
Easier to control globally and prevents nesting issues
not inherited

Example:

html {
  font-size: 16px;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 2rem; /* 2 × 16px = 32px 
}

p {
  font-size: 1rem; /* 1 × 16px = 16px 
}

use rem for base sizing, like font-size, padding, etc., where consistency is key.
Use em when you want components to scale based on their container. */



/* ch is a length unit. The 1ch is equal to the width of the "0"zero character of the current font*/

 2. Text containers
 
 p{

/* Most of the time we use % of vw */
/* The width of our paragraph is actually wider tham the width of our main element. we have actually set
